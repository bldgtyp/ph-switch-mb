Lightweight macOS menu-bar unit converter (feet, meters, Btu, ...). The app is triggered through the status bar and opens a split-view editor for inputs and results. Built using [rumps](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps), the Ridiculously Uncomplicated macOS Python Statusbar framework, and [PH_units](https://github.com/PH-Tools/PH_units) for parsing and conversions.

## Usage

- Enter one conversion per line using connectors such as `to` or `as`, for example `5 m to ft` or `12 inches as mm`.
- The left pane is editable; the right pane displays only the converted numeric result.
- Blank lines or unrecognized inputs produce blank outputs so you can draft notes inline.

## Online Version:
If you would rather have an online version of the converter, check out: [PH-Switch](https://github.com/bldgtyp/ph-switch)

## Development

- Build bytecode: `python -m compileall src`
- Launch locally: `uv run ph-switch-mb` or `briefcase dev`

## Build

This app uses [Briefcase](https://beeware.org/docs/briefcase/) to build the app.

```
briefcase create (only once)
briefcase build (to update)
briefcase package (for dmg)
```

> Briefcase installs `rumps` from the vendored wheel in `vendor/wheels`. Regenerate it with `uv run python -m pip wheel --no-deps --wheel-dir vendor/wheels "rumps==0.4.0"` if you upgrade the dependency.
